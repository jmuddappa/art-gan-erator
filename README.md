# Art GAN-erator
A project developed over three weeks at the Insight Fellowship that makes use of GANs + Style transfer to lower overhead costs of the ideation process for artists.



## Features
- **Attentional GAN** : Implemented an attentional GAN which is capable of paying attention to the relevant words in a given text input and uses it to generate novel images
- **Neural Style Transfer** : Implemented a fast neural style transfer docker container which takes an input of a content image generated by the AttnGAN and a user given style image and applies the style. 
- **Flask and Docker** : Made use of Flask and Docker to serve the two models in a distributed fashion so that multiple users can use the web application at the same time
- **AWS and PyTorch** : Coded on a p2.xlarge AWS machine making use of PyTorch to modify the models as required.

## Dependencies
1. pipenv
2. python 2.7 (does not work with Python 3!)
3. A GPU!


## Setup
1. Clone repository.

2. Enter the repository folder through your terminal and run setup.sh using: "sh setup.sh" - which will install all the necessary files, models and data. This process can take some time as there are around 2GB of files required for this project.

3. Create a virtual environment in root folder (i.e. art-gan-erator) using "pipenv shell". After this run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the necessary dependencies of the project. 

## Usage

### To run the AttGAN flask application:

To run the web application use:

    flask run


### To run the style transfer:


    sudo nvidia-docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/neural-style-docker:/images albarji/neural-style --content content.png --style style.png


## Results



## Troubleshooting
To install pyenv and python: 
     
    brew install pyenv
    pyenv install 2.7.10
    pyenv global 2.7.10


If any errors when installing python: 

    xcode-select --install
    xcode-select --reset
